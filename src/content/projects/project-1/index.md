- Led the technical team in building a highly scalable and user-friendly interface focused on real-time data monitoring and analysis for waste management.
- Developed the backend using **Golang (Gin framework)** and **PostgreSQL**, ensuring high performance and secure data handling.
- Built the frontend using **Next.js** and **React**, delivering a responsive and dynamic user experience.
- Implemented clean code principles and scalable architecture to ensure long-term maintainability, system security, and optimal performance.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Backend**: Golang, Gin Framework, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment & DevOps**: VPS, Docker (optional addition if used)
- **Methodologies**: Agile development, RESTful API design, Clean Architecture

This project plays a central role in Redooceitâ€™s mission to digitize community-based waste management and improve sustainability through data-driven insights.
