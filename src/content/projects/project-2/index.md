### Pandoe Web Service

As part of the **Bangkit Academy 2024 Capstone Project**, I contributed to the development of **Pandoe Web Service**, a scalable backend system designed to support modular and integrated digital services.

#### Key Contributions:
- Developed a scalable backend service using **Node.js** and deployed it on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to ensure high availability and performance.
- Utilized **Artifact Registry** for container image management, **Cloud Run** for scalable and cost-effective deployment, and **Cloud Storage Bucket** for efficient file handling and storage.
- Designed and implemented **RESTful APIs** to enable seamless integration across different modules and services within the system.
- Gained hands-on experience in cloud architecture design, CI/CD pipelines, and backend development best practices in a real-world environment.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Cloud Platform**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Deployment**: Cloud Run, Artifact Registry
- **Storage**: Cloud Storage Bucket
- **Methodologies**: RESTful API Design, Agile Development, Modular Architecture

This project provided foundational experience in building production-ready cloud-native applications and reinforced core DevOps and backend engineering principles.
