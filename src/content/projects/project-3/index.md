### VehicRent Backend System

**VehicRent** is a backend system developed as part of an academic project at **Telkom University**, designed to support an online vehicle rental platform. The system was built with scalability and maintainability in mind.

#### Key Contributions:
- Designed and implemented a robust **RESTful API** to support core functionalities of an online vehicle rental service.
- Applied **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to manage users, bookings, and vehicle inventory efficiently.
- Structured the application to be modular, ensuring ease of maintenance and future enhancements.
- Utilized **PostgreSQL** as the relational database to ensure data integrity and efficient query performance.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Backend Framework**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **API Design**: RESTful API
- **Development Principles**: OOP, Modular Architecture

This project provided hands-on experience in building scalable backend systems using industry-standard frameworks and laid the foundation for understanding enterprise-level application development.
