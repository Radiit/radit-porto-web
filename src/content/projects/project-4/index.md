### SahabatPeduli (Web3)

**SahabatPeduli** was my first hands-on experience in **Web3 development**, created as part of the **ICP Hub Hackathon**. The project aimed to provide a decentralized solution for transparent and secure tracking of community donations.

#### Key Contributions:
- Developed a **decentralized application (dApp)** using **ICP Ledger** and the **Makoto** framework to ensure trustless and tamper-proof transaction records.
- Designed the system to support transparent donation tracking, allowing donors and recipients to verify transactions independently.
- Gained foundational knowledge in blockchain-based development, smart contracts, and decentralized identity systems.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Blockchain**: Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)
- **Framework**: Makoto
- **Domain**: Web3, Decentralized Applications (dApps)

This project marked the beginning of my exploration into blockchain technology and its potential for building transparent, trustless systems that empower communities.
